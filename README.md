Amazing Sandbox (AS) is for running various tools inside a Docker sandbox.

- [x] Prevents [malicious packages](https://www.kaspersky.com/about/press-releases/kaspersky-uncovers-500k-crypto-heist-through-malicious-packages-targeting-cursor-developers) from having full disk access and stealing data
- [x] Prevents AI agents from [mistakenly](https://www.theregister.com/2025/12/01/google_antigravity_wipes_d_drive/) deleting all files on your disk
- [x] Optionally, run packages like linters [air-gapped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_gap_(networking)) (no internet access) as well

### Caches config of the following coding agents

The configuration of the following coding agents is mapped to the corresponding directories in
your home directory, so they will work seamlessly inside the sandbox without needing to
re-authenticate or re-configure them.

1. [Claude code](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/overview)
1. [OpenAI Codex](https://openai.com/codex/)
1. [Google Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli)

...
$ asb  -n cargo-exec fd '.*.go'
...
```

### Run [hadolint](https://github.com/hadolint/hadolint) (Haskell-based Dockerfile linter) inside the sandbox

```bash

...
```

## How I use it

For interactive shells, one can use bash aliases, for example, `alias htmlhint=asb -n npx htmlhint`.
However, this does not work for non-interactive shells, for example, inside [Makefile](https://ashishb.net/programming/use-makefile-for-android/).
So, I prefer creating `~/.local/bin` which contains `htmlhint` [file](https://github.com/ashishb/dotfiles/blob/master/_local_bin/htmlhint)
containing `asb npx htmlhint "$@"` and add `.local/bin` to the `$PATH` in `~/.bash_profile` via `export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin`.

## FAQ

1. Why not use [bubblewrap](https://github.com/containers/bubblewrap)?  
   It only [supports](https://github.com/containers/bubblewrap/issues/396) GNU/Linux.  
   Further, the developer experience for trying to run a simple tool like `htmlhint` or `yamllint` is sub-par.
1. Why not use [Firejail](https://github.com/netblue30/firejail)?  
   No support for Mac OS or Windows.  
   Further, the developer experience for trying to run a simple tool like `htmlhint` or `yamllint` is sub-par.
1. Why not use `sandbox-exec` on Mac OS?  
   `sandbox-exec` is [deprecated](https://github.com/openai/codex/issues/215)  
1. Why not use [ai-jail](https://github.com/akitaonrails/ai-jail)?
   `ai-jail` uses OS-level sandboxing via `bwrap` on Linux and the deprecated `sandbox-exec` on macOS.  
   It has no Windows support.  
   In contrast, `asb` uses Docker, which works consistently across Linux, macOS, and Windows.
1. Why not use [drop](https://github.com/wrr/drop)?  
   `drop` uses Linux mount namespaces for sandboxing and only supports Linux.  
   In contrast, `asb` uses Docker, which works consistently across Linux, macOS, and Windows.
1. I heard that Docker is not a [security boundary](https://kayssel.substack.com/p/docker-escape-breaking-out-of-containers)?
   Containers aren't as strong a security boundary as VMs; however, this means that a successful attack now requires infection of the container AND a concurrent container-escape vulnerability.
   That's a really high bar; someone would need to burn a 0-day on that. Taken from [here](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47612726)
