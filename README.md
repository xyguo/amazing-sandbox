Amazing Sandbox (AS) is for running various tools inside a Docker sandbox.

- [x] Prevents [malicious packages](https://www.kaspersky.com/about/press-releases/kaspersky-uncovers-500k-crypto-heist-through-malicious-packages-targeting-cursor-developers) from having full disk access and stealing data
- [x] Prevents AI agents from [mistakenly](https://www.theregister.com/2025/12/01/google_antigravity_wipes_d_drive/) deleting all files on your disk
- [x] Optionally, run packages like linters [air-gapped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_gap_(networking)) (no internet access) as well

## Features

### Caches config of the following coding agents

The config of the following coding agents is mapped to the corresponding directories in
your home directory, so, they will work seamlessly inside the sandbox without needing to
re-authenticate or re-configure them.

1. [Claude code](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/overview)
1. [Open AI Codex](https://openai.com/codex/)
1. [Google Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli)

### Installation

```
$ go install github.com/ashishb/amazing-sandbox/src/asb/cmd/asb@latest
...
```

Or download a binary from the [releases page](https://github.com/ashishb/amazing-sandbox/releases)

## Usage

### Run [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) with full access to current directory + a cache directory but no access to full disk

```bash
$ asb yarn install
...
```

### Run [HTML linter](https://www.npmjs.com/package/htmlhint) inside the sandbox with `-n`, that is, no Internet access

```bash
$ asb -n npx htmlhint
...  
```

### Run [yamllint](https://github.com/adrienverge/yamllint) inside the sandbox

```bash
$ asb uvx yamllint -d <path-to-dir-containing-yaml-files-to-lint>
...  
```

### Run [Claude code](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/overview) against the current directory

```bash
$ asb npx @anthropic-ai/claude-code
...  
```

### Run [Open AI Codex](https://openai.com/codex/) against the  directory "~/src/repo1"

```bash
$ asb -d ~/src/repo1 npx @openai/codex
...
```

### Run [Google Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli) inside the sandbox

```bash
$ asb npx @google/gemini-cli@latest
...
```

### Run [fd tool](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd) inside the sandbox with no Internet access

```bash
$ asb cargo install fd-find  # One time install
...
$ asb  -n cargo-exec fd '.*.go'
...
```

```

## How I use it

For interactive shells, one can use bash aliases, for example, `alias htmlhint=asb -n npx htmlhint`.
However, this does not work for non-interactive shells, for example, inside [Makefile](https://ashishb.net/programming/use-makefile-for-android/).
So, I prefer creating `~/.local/bin` which contains `htmlhint` [file](https://github.com/ashishb/dotfiles/blob/master/_local_bin/htmlhint)
containing `asb npx htmlhint "$@"` and add `.local/bin` to the `$PATH` in `~/.bash_profile` via `export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/.local/bin`.

## FAQ

1. Why not use [bubblewrap](https://github.com/containers/bubblewrap)?
   It only [supports](https://github.com/containers/bubblewrap/issues/396) GNU/Linux.
   Further, the developer experience for trying to run a simple tool like `htmlhint` or `yamllint` is sub-par.
1. Why not use [Firejail](https://github.com/netblue30/firejail)?
   No support for Mac OS or Windows.
   Further, the developer experience for trying to run a simple tool like `htmlhint` or `yamllint` is sub-par.
